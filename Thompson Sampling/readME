THOMPSON SAMPLING:

Thompson sampling is an algorithm for online decision problems
where actions are taken sequentially in a manner that
must balance between exploiting what is known to maximize
immediate performance and investing to accumulate
new information that may improve future performance. The
algorithm addresses a broad range of problems in a computationally
efficient manner and is therefore enjoying wide
use. This tutorial covers the algorithm and its application,
illustrating concepts through a range of examples, including
Bernoulli bandit problems, shortest path problems, product
recommendation, assortment, active learning with neural
networks, and reinforcement learning in Markov decision
processes. Most of these problems involve complex information
structures, where information revealed by taking an
action informs beliefs about other actions. We will also discuss
when and why Thompson sampling is or is not effective
and relations to alternative algorithms.
